# Orfium Hiring Assessment - AI/ML Research Engineer

This repository contains my submission for the Orfium AI Research Engineer Assessment. The assessment consists of two tasks: **Text Normalization** and **Cover Song Similarity**. I have opted to complete the **Text Normalization** task as the full implementation and provide a detailed report for the **Cover Song Similarity** task.
