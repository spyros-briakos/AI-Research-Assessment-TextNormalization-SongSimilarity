# Orfium Hiring Assessment - AI/ML Research Engineer

This repository contains my submission for the Orfium AI Research Engineer Assessment. The assessment consists of two tasks: Text Normalization and Cover Song Similarity. I have opted to complete the **Text Normalization** task as the full implementation and provide a detailed report for the **Cover Song Similarity** task.

## Repository Structure

- **Text_Normalization.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates my full implementation for the text normalization task.
- **Text_Normalization_Report.pdf**: A PDF report detailing my approach, methodology, and findings for the text normalization task.
- **Cover_Song_Similarity_Report.pdf**: A PDF that outlines my approach and methodology for the cover song similarity task. This task is not fully implemented, but the report provides a detailed explanation of the steps I would take.

## Time and Cost Breakdown

- **Time**: 
  - Each task took **2 days** to complete.
  - In total, I spent **4 days** on the full assessment, considering a **1-week deadline**.
  
- **Cost**:
  - The cost for utilizing OpenAI's models for text normalization (in terms of API calls) amounted to approximately **$2**.
